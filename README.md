# AEDBel: A quick AED-searching application

<img src="AED_Bel.png" alt="APP icon" width="120" height="120">

## Introduction ##

Titled "From bystander to hero," our project aims to enhance the survival chances of individuals experiencing sudden cardiac arrest by optimizing the placement of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) devices across Belgium.

AEDBel is an application developed, deployed, and operated by Group Italy from KU Leuven for the course Modern Data Analytics. The application is designed to save rescuers more valuable time whenever a cardiac arrest happens. Based on optimized AED locations, AEDBel requests users' locations to calculate the nearest AED in a short time. It provides walking/driving mode in terms of suggesting routes. It also displays points of interest and estimated time of arrival considering the rushy scenario. Besides, some tutorial videos about AED operation and CPR can be found in the APP.

## Data ##

Original datasets (AED location, interventions, and medical transport) provided are used for AED location optimization.

The data of optimized locations are used in the application: [aed_all_inv.xlsx](https://github.com/Moqian1122/aedbel/blob/main/aed_all_inv.xlsx).

## File ##

For the 'AED Prediction with Pipeline.ipynb' and 'requirements_prediction.txt', they are documents related with AED location optimization. For other documents, they are for AED searching and application deployment.

## Tip ##

Please run the code cautiously as it is connected to a billing account.

## Maintenance ##

The application is deployed using Heroku and continuously monitored. Please click [here](https://aedbel-4bb7a00847c1.herokuapp.com/) if you would like to visit the application.
