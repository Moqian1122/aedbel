## Introduction

AEDBel is an application developed, deployed and operated by Group Italy from KU Leuven for the course Modern Data Analytics.

Based on optimized AED locations, AEDBel requests users' location to calculate the nearest AED in a short time. It provides walking/driving mode in terms of suggesting routes. It also displays points of interest and estimated time of arrival considering the rushy scenario. Besides, some tutorial videos about AED operation and CPR could be found in the APP.
